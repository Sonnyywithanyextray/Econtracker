During my college freshmen year, I took a basic economics course, and the macro material was most fascinating to me. This is a basic and primitive program that uses PyQt5 for GUI, Matplotlib for data visualization, and sys for system-specific operations. The program allows users to explore and visualize Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data, a part of the macro material section, for various countries. It provides a very primitive interface where users can select a GDP metric (nominal or PPP) and one or more countries through dropdowns and checkboxes. The program dynamically generates bar charts to display the selected GDP data, offering an interactive and insightful tool for gaining a better understanding of the economic performance of different countries.
